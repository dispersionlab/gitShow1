# gitShow1
open ~/Synthia/Main.maxpat

Score: "Bleat Sampras"
Turn DSP On. Once you hear audio, experiment with all the settings. When max crashes, and it probably will then:
1. record the sound of your anguish in your favourite DAW
2. save it as yeaaarrgh.wav (precisely spelled) in ~/Synthia/, (overwrite it if it already exists)
3. 
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "i did it"
```

4. Then relaunch ~/Synthia/Main.maxpat
5. Drag 'yeaaarrgh.wav' into the soundfile loader in ~/Synthia/Main.maxpat
6. experiment some more, (repeat steps 1-6 where necessary)
7. Record the output for 30-45 seconds, save it as 'lemonade.wav'
8. 
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "acapella Kontakte"
```
