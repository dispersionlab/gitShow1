>## Score:

>Play with rhythmic generation through setting up content for the granulator to freeze and generate texture (given a square vave control freeze trigger) 

The score begins with a gradual fade in.

>Play with the first 4 prototype knobs to vary timbres produced - some have directly gitchy effects while moved.

At 20s, the composer starts to manipulate the piece with playful glitch effects. After a few seconds, they include "shh" noises.

>The top highlighted vcf acts as a filter for various frequency components of the generated audio - sweep in.

 At 40s, the piece sort of sounds like when one would change TV channels. I believe the composer uses this as a transition to introduce sweeping frequencies, while continuing to use it as an underlying accompaniment.

>The bottom highlighted lfo-1 controls the triggering of granulator freezes and texture cv.

>Play with the blend knob on texture synth to define how clean the signal out is.

At 51s, we can here the changing-channels noise to trigger (what I believe are) the granular freezes and texture cv.

Fade out at 1:20.
