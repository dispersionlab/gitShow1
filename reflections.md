## Reflections
I get so many details listening to it with the headphones.

There are many layers that add up with time.  
The drawing is a good representation of what is happening with the sound. 

When playing the recording, I put it in loop and it creates a, infinite sound. Beginning and end merge together.

The first 2 seconds, I see the sea and a sea-wave starting to get shape, the sea-wave transforms in the highway because I can hear cars and trucks honking. 
What it seems as white noise starts playing and exponentially taking presence. 
Different sounds are coming behind the white noise.  

From 00:14-00:16 High pitch sounds, something going super fast, appearing and dissapearing. I can hear a violin playing these high pitches.

**Layers playing together:** 

* Violin
* Honks
* Noise
* Highway

00:18- 00:22 Slow fade out to spacey, video-game like sounds. 
 
00:22 spacey, video-game like sounds with a little bit of noise that becomes more present at 00:32  

00:34 spacey sounds shut down, I can hear noise, is it rain? or a power plant breaking down?
  
   The sound of the highway is always in the background. 
    
   The spacey video game sounds come back, with the white noise.  
   
   Is it a TV? Trying to get signal with a rabbit antenna? And there is wind blowing.
    
**Is that wind the Pampero coming from the south? Is the Pampero meeting the Gardiner?** 
  

```
	'Yes, I know;' and turning to his companions, added,  
    'see, a change of weather is coming! We are going to have  
    a taste of PAMPERO.' And he went on to explain that this 
    PAMPERO is very common in the Argentine plains. It is an 
    extremely dry wind which blows from the southwest.[...]  
    The PAMPERO generally brings a tempest which lasts three days,  
    and may be always foretold by the depression of the mercury,'  
    he said. 'But when the barometer rises, on the contrary,  
    which is the case now, all we need expect is a few violent 
    blasts. So you can make your mind easy, my good friend;  
    by sunrise the sky will be quite clear again.'
