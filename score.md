>## Initial Observations

>>## Score:

>>Play with rhythmic generation through setting up content for the granulator to freeze and generate texture (given a square vave control freeze trigger) 

>The recording begins with a gradual fade in.
>- I think the fade in is a bit too long for me; I  believe that more effects could have been added to make the piece more dynammic.

>>Play with the first 4 prototype knobs to vary timbres produced - some have directly gitchy effects while moved.

>At 20s, the composer starts to manipulate the piece with playful glitch effects. After a few seconds, they mix in 'shh' noises.
>- I think the 'shh' noises are really interesting; they provide a different texture as well as signify an upcoming change to the piece.

>>The top highlighted vcf acts as a filter for various frequency components of the generated audio - sweep in.

>At 40s, the piece sort of sounds like when one would change TV channels. I believe the composer uses this as a transition to introduce sweeping frequencies, while continuing to use it as an underlying accompaniment.

>>The bottom highlighted lfo-1 controls the triggering of granulator freezes and texture cv.

>>Play with the blend knob on texture synth to define how clean the signal out is.

>At 51s, we can hear the changing-channels noise to trigger (what I believe are) the granular freezes and texture cv.

>Fade out at 1:20.

>## Experimentation with Previous Score

>- I'm finding that I'm using the texture synthesizer and the first 4 prototype knobs a lot more often than other modules.
>- I'm noticing that I look for ways to create beats. Perhaps, this relates to my dance practice and my fondness of creating movements based on a song's time signature.
>- Turning all the knobs all the way up creates a high pitched noice that cuts off every second.

>## Final Reflection

>- The way the score has been written seems more like a guide rather than telling exactly what they're doing in their recording. I appreciate having access to do this because it has helped me understand the VCV Rack patch while giving me space to experiment.
>- I wish there had been more noise in the low end (bass or drums).

Play around, and make some noise.
**Have fun! :)**
